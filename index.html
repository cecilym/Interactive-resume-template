        <div id="storycontents">
          <p>At the age of seventeen I left my hometown in Colorado to attend college at UC San Diego. I took a Symbolic Logic class my first term and fell in love with the subject, taking all the classes we had. It sounds crazy now, but I didn't know Symbolic Logic had any relationship to computer programming or anything else outside of the Philosophy department until much later. I was majoring in Anthropology and planned to go to graduate school for psychology, a family profession on both sides, but no matter what the class was I found myself putting all of my energy into creative presentations. I secretly took voice lessons on the side, feeding the creative part of me that I had taken for granted before college began. I realized that as much as I loved studying human culture, my passion lay in creating, performing, and telling humanity's stories. I took a leave of absence to study classical singing in my mother's homeland, Argentina. 
          <br><br>
          I found private instructors and supplemented my voice lessons with music theory classes at a local college. Everything was taught in Spanish, which I didn't really know, but I quickly learned a functional vocabulary. I read everything I could about the state of the music industry around the world.
           The more I learned, the more realized that the music industry was in denial. Music has existed as a cultural practice for most of recorded human history, but its growth as a business sector has always been tied to technological advances. The evolution of instruments, architecture, and written language shaped the music industry long ago as much as recording technology has shaped it in modern times. It saddened me that both artists and publishers were clinging to a dying business model based on decades old technology (CDs) and were paying the consequences. Imagine if Sony tried to sell people Sega Genesis erra game cartridges for the same price as PlayStation discs. That's what music publishers are trying to do today and most musicians aren't in a position to fight it. My experience in Argentina motivated me to go back to UCSD and change my major to Interdisciplinary Computing and the Arts, and my life has been on that trajectory ever since. I love the challenge of bringing mulitple forms of media together on an interactive digital stage. 
          <br><br>
          Two of the most challenging classes I took at UCSD were Electronics for Art A and B. They combined the study of electrical engineering, Arduino programming, and studio art practice. The pace was such that you couldn't wait to fully cover the electrical engineering concepts before applying them to your Arduino programs and studio work. I excelled by adapting assignments to fit my creative inclinations and applying logical structures I had learned studying Symbolic Logic my freshman year. My most important strategy was applying a theory I developed about good projects. My theory is that for a project to succeed, it must contain at least three of the following: humor, cleverness, emotional gravity, mysticism, aesthetic value, or being over the top in some way. For my final electronics project I used these principles to create a stop motion movie about electronics and technical confidence called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8mjd33ayfY">Barbie and the Solar Powered Car</a> that featured a working Arduino controlled set and solar powered car. 
          <br><br>
          I had to take a C++ class to graduate and I was so scared that I waited until my very last term. To my surprise I liked it, and once again my love of Symbolic Logic came into play. I was mad at myself for waiting until college was practically over to discover how much I enjoyed computer science. Two years later I left my job as Creative Director of a family run online education company to go back to school and study interactive media programming. Before starting at Ex'pression College in Emeryville, I attended summer school at UC Santa Cruz because of their exciting electronic music and game design departments. My first course was a two week intensive in algorithmic computer music taught by David Cope. We learned LISP, worked all hours, and made final pieces in that short period of time. Mine was an algorithm that took the 72 Names of God, itself an ancient algorithm from the Old Testament, and turned it into an aesthetically pleasing MIDI performance that I played through a beautiful piano synthesizer in Ableton Live. I followed up the intensive with an interactive fiction course with Aaron Reed where we learned to create games using the Inform7 language. When summer session ended I began my coursework at Ex'pression where I studied music production, graphic design, and project management. This year I began seriously studying web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Ruby.  Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby has become one of my favorite books of all time. I feel so fortunate to have been able to go back to school and hone in on this path. I pay it forward by managing the Twitter account for a non-profit called Shukuru that helps girls in Tanzania pay for their secondary education by teaching them how to raise chickens and sell them at their local market.
          <br><br>
          My experiences at UCSD, Argentina, Santa Cruz and elsewhere taught me that I love being challenged well beyond my current capacity. My dream job would involve using my programming skills to help a creative team bring graphics, audio, and text to interactive life while meeting the data and user experience needs of our company. I am currently working at a startup where I am using JavaScript and Appcelerator's Titanium platform to build a specialized mobile game leaderboard app for iOS devices. We hope the finish our prototype in late July, at which time it will be handed off to native iOS developers and I will be ready for my next media programming adventure.</p>
